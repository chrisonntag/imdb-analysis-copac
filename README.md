# Exploratory Analysis on the IMDB Binary Dataset and COPAC implementation

Exploratory analysis part of the Data Mining course. All the utility functions are used from the 
[ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond](https://github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset) repository. 

We are also comparing our COPAC implementation with the [ELKI](https://elki-project.github.io) implementation which is 
why the \*.jar is part of this repository. 

## Setup
Just clone this repository and install packages with pip from the ```requirements.txt``` file. I altered some 
of the code from the TUDataset repo so that we don't have to deal with the correct version numnber of torch 
since we don't need torch for our uses anyway.
